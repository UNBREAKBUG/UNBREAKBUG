## About Me

I focus on how systems fail, how attacks unfold, and how defensive strategies can be engineered to counter real-world adversaries. My work centers on vulnerability assessment, penetration testing fundamentals, reconnaissance, and cyber defense techniques. I build and analyze security labs, study attack surfaces, and solve CTF challenges to understand practical threat behavior.

I aim to develop into a cybersecurity consultant specializing in identifying weaknesses, evaluating risks, and strengthening organizational security through evidence-based analysis.
