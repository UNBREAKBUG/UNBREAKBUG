## About Me

I focus on understanding how systems fail, how attacks propagate, and how defensive strategies can be engineered to stop them. My work centers on vulnerability assessment, penetration testing fundamentals, reconnaissance, network and web security, and practical cyber defense.

I learn through hands-on experimentation, security labs, controlled attack simulations, and CTF challenges that reflect real-world adversarial behavior. My objective is to evolve into a cybersecurity consultant capable of identifying weaknesses, evaluating risks, and improving security posture through structured, evidence-driven analysis.
