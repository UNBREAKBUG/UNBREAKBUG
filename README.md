## About Me

I focus on understanding how systems fail, how attacks propagate, and how defensive strategies can be engineered to stop them. My work centers around vulnerability assessment, penetration testing fundamentals, reconnaissance, and practical cyber defense. I learn through hands-on security labs, attack surface analysis, and CTF challenges that replicate real-world adversarial behavior.

My objective is to become a cybersecurity consultant capable of identifying weaknesses, evaluating risks, and strengthening security postures through structured and evidence-driven approaches.
