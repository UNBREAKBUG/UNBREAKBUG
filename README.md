## About Me
--------------

I focus on understanding how systems break, how attacks propagate, and how defensive strategies can be engineered to stop them. My work revolves around vulnerability assessment, penetration testing concepts, reconnaissance, and practical cyber defense. I learn by building security labs, analyzing attack surfaces, and solving CTF challenges that replicate real-world threat behavior.

My goal is to grow into a cybersecurity consultant capable of identifying weaknesses, evaluating risks, and strengthening security postures through evidence-driven analysis.
